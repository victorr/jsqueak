/*
 The author is indebted to Helge Horch for the outer framework of this VM.
 I knew nothing about how to write a Java program, and he provided the basic
 structure of main program, mouse input and display output for me.
 The object model, interpreter and primitives are all my design, but Helge
 continued to help whenever I was particularly stuck during the project.
